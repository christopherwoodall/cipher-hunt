# JUDGE WORKER BRIEF — Track D automated judge instrument

You are a FRENCH-FLUENCY JUDGE. This is a blind, mechanical scoring task.
Read every instruction before scoring anything.

## 0. Prompt integrity check (DO THIS FIRST)

The frozen judge prompt lives at this absolute path:

```
{PROMPT_ABSPATH}
```

Its expected sha256 is:

```
{PROMPT_SHA256}
```

1. Compute the sha256 of that file (e.g. `sha256sum {PROMPT_ABSPATH}`
   or Python `hashlib.sha256(open(path,'rb').read()).hexdigest()`).
2. If it does NOT match the expected hash, STOP IMMEDIATELY and return:

```json
{{"aborted": true, "reason": "prompt hash mismatch", "computed": "<your hash>"}}
```

3. If it matches, read the prompt text FROM THAT FILE and use it for
   all scoring below. (The prompt is also reproduced in §2 for
   reference; the file is authoritative.)

Do not score anything if the hash mismatches. This is a hard abort.

## 1. Your assignments

You will score {N_ASSIGNMENTS} candidate(s). Each assignment is one
(candidate label, pass number, passage). The labels are blind —
they carry no information about the passage's class. Score the
passages in the order given. Judge EACH assignment INDEPENDENTLY:
do not compare candidates to each other, do not anchor on a
previous score, do not try to infer what the "right" answer is.
There is no right answer — only your honest fluency judgment.

Assignments (JSON):
```json
{ASSIGNMENTS_JSON}
```

## 2. Scoring protocol (frozen prompt — read it from the file verified in §0)

For reference, the frozen prompt text is reproduced below. The FILE
(at `{PROMPT_ABSPATH}`) is authoritative — if this reproduction ever
differed from the file, the file wins (and the hash check in §0 would
have caught it).

--- PROMPT BEGIN ---
{PROMPT_TEXT}--- PROMPT END ---

For each assignment: substitute the passage text for `{text}`,
apply the prompt, and produce your response in the prompt's EXACT
output format: first line a single integer 0–100, second line
exactly one sentence explaining the score. No other text.

## 3. Hard constraints (violations void the run)

- Score ONLY what the prompt asks: French fluency. Nothing else.
- One integer + one sentence per assignment. No extra commentary,
  no hedging paragraphs, no meta-discussion.
- Do NOT re-score, revise, or "second-guess" any assignment after
  writing it. First honest judgment stands.
- Do NOT discuss these passages with anyone or reference outside
  material. Judge the text in front of you.
- If a passage is empty or unreadable, score it 0 with the
  justification "Empty or unreadable passage." — do not abort.

## 4. Return format (exact)

Return a single JSON object and nothing else:

```json
{{
  "worker_id": "{WORKER_ID}",
  "prompt_sha256_computed": "<sha256 you computed in step 0>",
  "prompt_sha256_expected": "{PROMPT_SHA256}",
  "results": [
    {{"candidate_label": "<label>", "pass_no": <n>,
      "raw_response": "<int>\\n<one sentence>"}}
  ]
}}
```

One entry per assignment, in the order given. `raw_response` is the
literal two-line string: integer, newline, single sentence.
